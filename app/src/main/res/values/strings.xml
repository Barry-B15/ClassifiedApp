        "But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and
        praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and
        expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder
        of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it
        is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally
        encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who
        loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because
        occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great
        pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical
        exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault
        with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who
        avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"
